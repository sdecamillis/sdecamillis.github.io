These are the only files you need to edit:

./_config.yml
./assets/DeCamillis_CV.pdf
./assets/DeCamillis_photo.png
./_data/navigation.yml

And this is where I store the contents of my website, feel free to use a similar approach:

./_pages/*
./assets/analytics/*   (./assets_offline/ version for draft files, excluded in git)
./assets/community/*   (./assets_offline/ version for draft files, excluded in git)
./assets/research/*    (./assets_offline/ version for draft files, excluded in git)
