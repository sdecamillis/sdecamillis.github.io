To run a local copy, make sure that the Gemfile and Gemfile.lcok exist. They are locally generated files to run the jekyll server using ruby.

If they exist, then simply run these commands:

	cd /path/to/directory/
	bundle exec jekyll serve

The website will then be accessible at the localhost address:

	http://localhost:4000/





To run online website:
	- create (or update) the GitHub repository
	- rename the repository as "[NAME].github.io"
	- make the repository public
