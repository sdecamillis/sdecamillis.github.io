To run a local copy, make sure that the Gemfile and Gemfile.lcok exist. They are locally generated files to run the jekyll server using ruby.

If they exist, then simply run these commands:

	cd /path/to/directory/
	bundle exec jekyll serve

The website will then be accessible at the localhost address:

	http://localhost:4000/


To run online website:
	- create (or update) the GitHub repository
	- rename the repository as "[NAME].github.io"
	- make the repository public



These are the only files you need to edit:

./_config.yml
./assets/DeCamillis_CV.pdf
./assets/DeCamillis_photo.png
./_data/navigation.yml

And this is where I store the contents of my website, feel free to use a similar approach:

./_pages/*
./assets/analytics/*   (./assets_offline/ version for draft files, excluded in git)
./assets/community/*   (./assets_offline/ version for draft files, excluded in git)
./assets/research/*    (./assets_offline/ version for draft files, excluded in git)
