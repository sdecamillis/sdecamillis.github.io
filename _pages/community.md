### Water safety in Timor-Leste

In February 2023 I joined a collaborative effort between the Australian National University, Engineers Without Borders Australia, and non-profit Abundant Water set to increase resilient access to clean drinking water in Timor-Leste.

Access to clean drinking water is one of life's most fundamental necessities, ensuring the well-being of communities and enabling them to thrive. Much of Timor-Leste does not have centralized water treatment and distribution systems. Individuals rely on the collection of water from a number of untreated sources, leading to negative health and economic impacts. The project supported the installation of low-cost ceramic water filters at 650 households and 4 schools to ensure quality potable water at the point of consumption. It also sought to evaluate the use of the filters, their effectiveness for filtering contaminants, and potential health outcomes from their use.

### Open science education

MeriSTEM is a program dedicated to the creation of free educational content and online resources for learning. The course material is pitched to the level of high-school students to provide teachers with the ability of integrating their classes with flipped learning techniques. I contributed to this program by reviewing and improving the accessibility of educational resources on physics..

### Australian wildlife

The Australian Capital Territory is home to a great variety of wildlife, often in many cases unique to the region. Since the beginning of 2022 I have been involved with ACT Wildlife in a beautiful journey of care and preservation for the many species of birds, marsupials, reptiles, and bat species that inhabit the territory. Through this organization I had the privilege of contributing to the welfare of the native wildlife in numerous ways â€” through direct intervention by rescuing injured or sick animals, transporting them to experienced carer volunteers, and releasing them back into their natural habitat at the end of their recovery, as well as through indirect support, as a phone operator for the 24/7 rescue hotline and with community awareness campaigns.

### Emergency services

In March 2024 I joined the Australian Capital Territory's State Emergency Services, a volunteer-based organization dedicated to providing assistance during natural disasters, severe weather events, and other emergencies. I look forward to sharing further details about this experience in the future!
