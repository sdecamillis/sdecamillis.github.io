## Microscopy and nanomaterials


### Non-linear response of YbTm particles

Upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) are a unique class of optical nanomaterials doped with lanthanide ions. 
Thanks to their excellent and flexible luminescence performance, they enabled significant advances in a broad range of applications, such as photo-activated drug delivery, IR vision extension, security ink, and [super-resolution imaging](/research/#super-resolution-imaging).

In this project, I characterized the luminescence response of a specific class of nanoparticles demonstrating how the right selection of particle composition and structure can dramatically enhance their emission properties. This single-particle study was made possible by developing a suitable [dual-beam confocal miscoscope](/instrumentation/#dual-beam-confocal-microscope) which enabled super-resolution imaging with single-photon detection. 

This work was fundamental to successfully maximise the brightness of these particles at very low light excitation and demonstrating their viability for LED-driven scanning imaging.

{% comment %} 
Research in versitile nanoprobes is key to enable majour advances in optical microscopy. Bright, photostable, chromatic multiplexing, non-linear emission.

Major efforts have been dedicated to extend the repeatability of the STED imaging, as the common contrast agents (fluorophores) progressively fade while scanning repeatitively the same speciment. Up-convertion nanoparticles (UCNPs) are the most promising alternative, thanks to their bright emission and photo-stability.

In this project, I optically characterised a specific class of nanoparticles demonstrating how the particle composition and structure directly affect their emission properties. At suitable conditions, these nanoparticles can enable LED-driven imaging.

### Super-resolution imaging

Light cannot be focused down indefinitively, ultimately limited by the laws of quantum mechanics. However, in the past few decades, clever solutions have been developped to circumvent such limit and observe objects as small as few tens of nanometres.

In the quest to make super-resolution microscopy easier and more applicable, Up-convertion nanoparticles (UCNPs) have demonstrated great potentials. They have proved to be suitable for *STimulated Excitation Depletion* (STED) microscopy and *Super-linear Excitation-Emission* (SEE) microscopy, providing enhanced photostability and spectral selectivity compared to the common contrast agents. 

This project explored the non-linear optical properties of UCNPs to push their performance beyond their current limits. With the suitable excitation conditions and particle composition, these nanoprobes can enable simultaneous STED and SEE modalities, further enhancing the imaging resolution. These results were successfully applied in a biological environment.

## Molecular Physics


### De-excitation processes in nucleosides

The stability of the DNA molecules against photon irradiation has been crucial for the successful development of life on Earth. However, little is known about the fundamental processes responsible for the DNA photo-stability, due to its size and complexity.

Studies of the primary building blocks of the DNA, the nucleobases, have uncovered an exception ability to disperse the absorbed energy in the sourrounding environment through non-radiative relaxation pathways, within short timescales of picoseconds. In a bottom-up approach to understand the DNA resiliace upon photon irradiation, the next step involves the study of the photo stability of nucleosides, the combination of the nucleobases with the sugar group. However, such relatively complex molecules have only been investigates in solutions due to the challeging task of producing them in vapour form.

This project achieved a stable protocol for generating neutral nucleosides in gas phase and produced the first measurement of lifetime of the first excited state in all of the DNA nucleosides following UV excitation.

### Sugar-base charge transfer

The experimental study of fragmentation processes in ionised molecules is fundamental to learn more about molecular reactivity and predict the likehood of specific dissociative pathways.

In this project, the fragmentation of nucleosides was explored specifically upon ionisation induced by either photon- or proton- irradiation. These experiments demonstrated how the binding energy of local sub-structures determines the charge localisation upon dissociative ionisation.

### Attosecond charge migration

Interacting with the electron density of a molecule on a timescale sufficiently short to preceed any nuclear influence is a fundamental step towards the possibility of steering dissociative processes and ultimately achieving reactivity control.

This project was first in the generation and observation of coherent charge oscillations in molecules. These experiments were enabled by the interaction with the shortest laser pulses currently available.

## Plasma Physics


### Dynamics at the magnetosphere


The magnetic field sourrounding the Earth acts as powerful shield against the constant stream of charged particles emitted by the Sun, which would otherwise directly impact our life on Earth. The dynamics of such solar wind at the boundary of the magnetosphere is of primary interest for space plasma modeling, as it involves a wide range of spatial and temporal scales.

This project focused on extending the classic magneto-hydrodynamic model of the plasma fluid evolution to include anysotropic variations of particle dynamics, either parallel or perpendicular to the field lines. This model enabled the study of several non-linear processes occurring at the magnetosphere and their competing evolution depending on the dynamic regime of the plasma.
