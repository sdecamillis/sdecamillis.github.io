## Road Safety in ACT

![ArcGIS](https://img.shields.io/badge/ArcGIS-2C7AC3?logo=arcgis&logoColor=fff)

In this project, I combined local road infrastructue network data of the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) with public domain reports on cycling accidents. By merging databases and using geometry integration strategies, I mapped out sensitive safety hazard points that could inform future governance decisions.

## Navigation

For planning off-trail hikes and practicing map navigation, I create high-resolution topographic maps with the my python module [qgis_nsw_act_topo](https://github.com/sdecamillis/qgis_nsw_act_topo). This tool allows for the automated generation of maps of a specific area of interest, with the possibility to include the latest data on vegetation coverage and wooded areas. I also utilise Digital Elevation Model (DEM) raster tiles to generate hillshade effects and contour lines, enhancing the map's detail and accuracy.

## ACTSES Training

Orienteering and navigation are essential skills for ACTSES members, particularly during remote search operations. As the Deputy Training Officer at the local SES Unit, I planned and coordinated an offsite navigation exercise at Mount Stromlo. To support the activity, I developed a custom map highlighting key features such as ponds, rivers, hilltops, and transmission linesâ€”key reference elements for navigating towards control points.

{% comment %}
I am interested in developing and using topographic maps for hiking and navigation activities. For this purpose, I learned how to build topo maps with the open-source software QGIS, giving me freedom to display only the features relevant for each specific exercise.

I use vegetation raster data as base layer and I superimpose a hill-shade layer generated from 5-metre DEM data. Then, I import all the vector layers, including contour lines and geographical points of interest, from the NSW and ACT GIS databases.

I crated a python script to automate the download of the required data and the map generation with the customised symbology style. Below a couple of examples.
