Welcome to my website!

I’m an optical physicist, fascinated by everything from optics and nanoscale imaging to numerical modelling and data visualisation. 

I like to explore a wide range of scientific fields, and when I’m not immersed in research and development, I’m often out hiking, climbing, or orienteering. 

Feel free to explore the site, and if you'd like to get in touch, send an email!
