Welcome to my website!

I’m a physicist, with expertise in imaging technologies, statistical analysis of data, and mapping.

I like to explore a wide range of scientific fields, and when I’m not immersed in research and development, I’m often out hiking, climbing, or orienteering. 

Feel free to explore the site, and if you'd like to get in touch, send an email!
